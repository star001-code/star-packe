# Overview

This project is an **Iraqi Customs Duty Difference Calculator** (حاسبة فرق الرسم الكمركي), a full-stack web application designed to calculate customs duties and fees at Iraqi checkpoints. Its primary purpose is to allow users to search a comprehensive product database using HS codes or descriptions, view product valuation data, and accurately calculate duty differences. The application features an Arabic RTL interface with a default dark mode, catering specifically to the Iraqi customs environment. The product database contains 16,322 products covering 96 HS chapters (out of 97) with 4,689 unique HS codes. The AI manifest extraction uses the `gpt-5.1` model via Replit AI Integrations with `max_completion_tokens` parameter.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language (Arabic).

# System Architecture

## Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management/Data Fetching**: TanStack React Query v5
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui (new-york style) built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming, dark mode enabled by default with a premium dark theme featuring golden/amber accent colors, glass-morphism cards, gradient backgrounds, and backdrop blur effects. A light mode with a warm cream/amber palette is also available via a theme toggle.
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Language/Direction**: Arabic (RTL)
- **Pages**:
    - Dashboard home page (`/`)
    - Login/Register page (`/login`)
    - Product search page (`/search`)
    - Customs duty calculator (`/calculator`)
    - About page (`/about`)
    - Manifest upload page (`/manifest`) with AI-powered image extraction
    - Customs Tariff data table page (`/tariff`) with advanced server-side sorting, column filtering, HS code search, description search, and pagination
- **UI/UX Decisions**:
    - Consistent premium dark theme with golden/amber accents (hsl 38).
    - Glass-morphism cards, gradient backgrounds, and backdrop blur effects.
    - Redesigned login, home, and about pages with enhanced visual elements (e.g., glowing cards, hero banners, animated nav cards, refined tables).
    - Sidebar and header feature gold gradient branding and backdrop blur.
    - Custom utility classes for consistent styling: `glass-card`, `gradient-gold`, `gradient-dark`, `glow-gold`, `text-gradient-gold`.
    - Refined scrollbar styling and improved border/card contrast in dark mode.
    - Theme toggle with localStorage persistence and dynamic `meta theme-color` updates.

## Backend
- **Framework**: Express 5 (TypeScript, ESM)
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Authentication**: session-based using `express-session` with `connect-pg-simple` and `bcryptjs` for password hashing.
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API under `/api/` prefix.
- **Key Features**:
    - Product search by HS code or description.
    - Calculation of customs duties, including additional taxes (sales tax, municipal tax).
    - AI-powered manifest image extraction (using OpenAI GPT-4o Vision) to extract HS codes, descriptions, quantities, values, and other metadata from customs documents.
    - Auto-classification of goods into Iraqi tariff categories.
    - Comprehensive duty calculation logic incorporating Iraqi Customs Tariff Law No. 22/2010 and Council of Ministers duty reduction tables.
    - CIF valuation rule implementation (min/max checks).
    - Simplified duty calculation formula based on weight, value, and duty rate.
- **Request Validation**: Zod schemas.

## Database
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with `drizzle-zod`.
- **Schema**: Includes tables for `users`, `checkpoints`, `checkpoint_fees`, and an expanded `products` table.
    - `products` table contains HS code, CST code, description, unit, weight, unit_price, min/avg/max values, `duty_rate`, `is_protected`, `protection_level` (low/medium/high/none), `protection_percentage`, `decision_action` (استيراد/استيراد بحذر/لا تستورد), `decision_risk` (منخفض/متوسط/عالي), and `decision_reason`.
- **Seeding**: Populated with 12,601 products from `products_with_decision.json` (all USD, with protection + decision data). Duty rates are looked up from `tariff_law22_2010.json`. Checkpoint data also re-seeds on startup.
